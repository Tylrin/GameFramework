# Project Philosophy 
The main goal is to create a complete game framework that is both versatile and easy to understand. The driving philosophy of the project is to be as engine agnostic as possible. That mean relying heavely on the build-in engine codebase and not implementing any online services to guarantee the highest longevity and best platform compatibility.
